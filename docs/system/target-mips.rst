MIPS System emulator
--------------------

Four executables cover simulation of 32 and 64-bit MIPS systems in both
endian options, ``qemu-system-mips``, ``qemu-system-mipsel``
``qemu-system-mips64`` and ``qemu-system-mips64el``. Several different
machine types are emulated:

-  The MIPS Malta prototype board \"malta\"

-  An ACER Pica \"pica61\". This machine needs the 64-bit emulator.

-  A MIPS Magnum R4000 machine \"magnum\". This machine needs the
   64-bit emulator.

-  An SGI Origin 200 server \"origin200\". This machine needs the
   64-bit big-endian emulator.

The Malta emulation supports the following devices:

-  Core board with MIPS 24Kf CPU and Galileo system controller

-  PIIX4 PCI/USB/SMbus controller

-  The Multi-I/O chip's serial device

-  PCI network cards (PCnet32 and others)

-  Malta FPGA serial device

-  Cirrus (default) or any other PCI VGA graphics card

The Boston board emulation supports the following devices:

-  Xilinx FPGA, which includes a PCIe root port and an UART

-  Intel EG20T PCH connects the I/O peripherals, but only the SATA bus
   is emulated

The ACER Pica emulation supports:

-  MIPS R4000 CPU

-  PC-style IRQ and DMA controllers

-  PC Keyboard

-  IDE controller

The MIPS Magnum R4000 emulation supports:

-  MIPS R4000 CPU

-  PC-style IRQ controller

-  PC Keyboard

-  SCSI controller

-  G364 framebuffer

The SGI Origin 200 emulation models one or two nodes of the product:
one or two R10000 processors per node, each node's Hub ASIC (the
per-node interrupt controller, real-time counter and block transfer
engines), and the base I/O board behind the Hub's crosstalk port:

-  SGI Bridge crosstalk-to-PCI host bridge, with its address
   translation table modelled as an IOMMU

-  Two QLogic ISP1040 SCSI host adapters

-  SGI IOC3 multifunction I/O controller: two 16550 serial ports with
   the chip's receive and transmit DMA rings, and the ethernet
   interface with its DP83840 transceiver

-  M48T35 timekeeper NVRAM, optionally backed by a drive so the
   firmware environment persists

-  The entry-level system controller, reached over the Hub's PCF8584
   I2C master

Serial backends map as: 0 and 1 to the IOC3's two rear ports, 2 to the
system controller's diagnostic port, 3 to the debug UART enabled by the
``junk-uart`` machine option. By default the machine synthesizes the
firmware structures a kernel loaded with ``-kernel`` expects; booting
SGI's own PROM image instead is done with ``-bios`` and
``synthesized-firmware=off``. See the ``origin200`` machine's property
descriptions for the remaining options.

The Fuloong 2E emulation supports:

-  Loongson 2E CPU

-  Bonito64 system controller as North Bridge

-  VT82C686 chipset as South Bridge

-  RTL8139D as a network card chipset

The Loongson-3 virtual platform emulation supports:

-  Loongson 3A CPU

-  LIOINTC as interrupt controller

-  GPEX and virtio as peripheral devices

nanoMIPS System emulator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Executable ``qemu-system-mipsel`` also covers simulation of 32-bit
nanoMIPS system in little endian mode:

-  nanoMIPS I7200 CPU

Example of ``qemu-system-mipsel`` usage for nanoMIPS is shown below:

Start system emulation of Malta board with nanoMIPS I7200 CPU::

   qemu-system-mipsel -cpu I7200 -kernel <kernel_image_file> \
       -M malta -serial stdio -m <memory_size> -drive file=<disk_image_file>,format=raw \

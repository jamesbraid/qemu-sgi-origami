 * SGI Origin 200/2000 ("SN0", IP27) physical address map.
 *
 * The machine presents one flat 40-bit physical address space shared by every
 * node. The node number occupies the top eight of those bits, so a node's
 * memory, registers, crosstalk windows and boot flash all appear at a fixed
 * stride and any node's resources are reached by changing those bits alone.
 * Origin 200 has one node, so every stride collapses onto the same window, but
 * the arithmetic is modeled from the start because making the node count a
 * machine option later is cheap and retrofitting it is not.
 *
 * Above the physical address the processor's uncached attribute picks which of
 * four spaces an uncached reference means. That attribute is a signal beside
 * the address rather than part of it, so the memory system sees it in the two
 * bits above the physical address, and the space that means memory is placed at
 * window zero so that a plain physical address still means memory.

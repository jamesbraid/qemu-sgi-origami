 * SGI IOC3 base I/O controller: the serial console first.
 *
 * The chip is one PCI device with a single base address register covering
 * everything it has, and the console lives in a window near the top of that
 * range which is unlike the rest of the chip. The SuperIO window at offset
 * 0x20000 holds byte-wide registers a single byte apart, where the chip's own
 * blocks are thirty-two bits wide. Getting that stride wrong is the most
 * likely way to produce a console that emits nothing, so the two ports declare
 * their access width explicitly rather than inheriting a default.
 *
 * Only the two serial ports are modelled here. The rest of the chip's window
 * is deliberately left as a hole, so an access to something unimplemented
 * reaches no device and is reported, rather than decoding and returning a
 * plausible zero. On a machine with one node, one processor and no I/O, zero
 * is the right answer to a great many questions, which is exactly what makes
 * answering all of them dangerous.
 *
 * The register file itself is QEMU's, wrapped rather than reimplemented. What
 * this file supplies is the machine's view of it: the byte stride, the byte
 * width, and the endianness.

 * The ports' access contract, which is the whole reason this wrapper exists
 * rather than using the register file's own region directly.
 *
 * Three things differ from what that region declares. The machine is
 * big-endian where the register file assumes the little-endian PCI I/O space
 * it was written for; the registers are one byte apart rather than at the
 * four-byte stride the chip's other blocks use; and an access wider than a
 * byte is refused.
 *
 * That last one is a choice, and the datasheet records it as a choice rather
 * than a finding. Nothing in the sources or in either guest says what the
 * hardware does with a wider access, and no correct driver issues one, so no
 * observation settles it. Refusing is the option that cannot be wrong quietly:
 * the memory system reports the attempt, and the report can only ever fire on
 * a real defect. Silently narrowing, which is what the register file's own
 * wrapper does, is the one option with nothing to recommend it, because it is
 * an unknown presented as known.
 *
 * The endianness is declared and then left alone. A big-endian processor
 * reaching a little-endian part needs its byte lanes placed, and both guests
 * expect that: one does it in its bus accessors, the other in its driver. The
 * device must not do its own lane arithmetic on top, because that cancels out
 * against one guest and doubles against the other, which is the worst failure
 * available here.
